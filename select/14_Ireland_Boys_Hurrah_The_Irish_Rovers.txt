In Pennsylvanian woods we've met from one bright island flown.
Great is the land we tread, but yet out heart is with our own.
And ere we leave this shanty small while fades the autumn day,
We'll toast old Ireland dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.
Ireland boys hooray, oh Ireland boys hooray
We'll toast old Ireland, Dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.

We've heard her faults a hundred times, the new ones and the old.
In songs and sermons, rants andrhymes, enlarged some fifty-fold.
But take them all, the great and small, and this we've got to say:
Here's loved old Ireland, dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.
Ireland boys hooray, oh Ireland boys hooray
We'll toast old Ireland, Dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.

We know that brave and true men tried to crack her rusty chain.
The patriots suffered, the martyrs died, and all 'tis said in vain.
But no boy, no, a glance will show, how far they've won their way.
Here's brave old ireland, dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.
Ireland boys hooray, oh Ireland boys hooray
We'll toast old Ireland, Dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.

We've seen the wedding and the wake, the patron and the fair.
Lithe young frames and the dear old games in the kindly Irish air.
And the loud "Harroo" we have heard it too, and the thundering "Clear the way!"
Here's gay old ireland, dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.
Ireland boys hooray, oh Ireland boys hooray
We'll toast old Ireland, Dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.

In Pennsylvanian woods we've met and may never see again,
The dear old land where our hearts are set and our first fond hopes remain.
But come, fill up another cup, and with every sup we'll say,
We'll toast old Ireland, Dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.
Ireland boys hooray, oh Ireland boys hooray
We'll toast old Ireland, Dear old Ireland, Ireland boys hooray.
